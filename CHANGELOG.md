# Changelog

## v1.10.0

This release updates Buildroot to 2019.11 with security and bug fix updates
across Linux packages. Enables dnsd, udhcpd and ifconfig in the default 
Busybox configuration to support `vintage_net` and `vintage_net_wizard`. 
See the `nerves_system_br` notes for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.10.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
  * Erlang 22.1.8

## v1.9.2

This release updates Buildroot to 2019.08.2 with security and bug fix updates
across Linux packages. See the `nerves_system_br` notes for details.
Erlang/OTP is now at 22.1.7.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.9.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.9.5)

## v1.9.1

This release pulls in security and bug fix updates from `nerves_system_br`.
Erlang/OTP is now at 22.1.1.

IMPORTANT: The IEx prompt was being output on the UART. This was inconsistent
with other Nerves/Raspberry Pi systems and has been fixed. If you want to
use the UART, you'll need to override the `erlinit.config` file.

* Bug fixes
  * Default to displaying the iex prompt on the HDMI port like the other
    Raspberry Pi systems
  * Compile in the I2C drivers so they're available early on for NervesKey and
    other use at initialization

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.9.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.9.4)
  * linux - update to the raspberrypi-kernel_1.20190925-1 tag

## v1.9.0

NOTE: bootcode.bin is not used by the RPi 4 and is no longer built.
  If updating a fork of this project, be sure to remove references to it from
  your fwup.conf. See
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md

This release updates Buildroot to 2019.08 with security and bug fix updates
across Linux packages. See the `nerves_system_br` notes for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.9.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.9.2)

* Enhancements
  * Support a variety of USB->UART adapters so more devices work out-of-the-box

## v1.8.2

This release fixes an issue that broke display output on small LCD screens.
Updating the Raspberry Pi firmware to the latest from the Raspberry Pi
Foundation fixed the issue. See
https://github.com/fhunleth/rpi_fb_capture/issues/2 for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.8.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.8.5)

## v1.8.1

This is the initial Nerves System release for the Raspberry Pi 4. It's version
corresponds to other Nerves System releases for Raspberry Pi's for ease of
referring to version numbers.

While similar looking, the Raspberry Pi 4 has some significant differences with
other Raspberry Pis. The following functionality appears to work so far:

1. Support for up to 4 GB of DRAM (1 GB and 2 GB versions supported too)
2. I2C, SPI, and GPIO - The RPi 4 has additional pin mux options. They have not
   been tested.
3. The primary UART has not been redirected away from the Bluetooth module. This
   is useful for using BLE with the Harald library, but is different from the
   other RPi defaults
4. The Pi Camera and Raspberry Pi Foundation 7" Touchscreen both work
5. Gigabit Ethernet works
6. WiFi appears to work
7. USB 3 devices

The following major features have not been tested:

1. OpenGL support and HDMI output
2. USB Gadget mode via the USB C connector (the gadget drivers are currently
   enabled, though)

Additionally, the Raspberry Pi 4 port uses 32-bit mode on the ARM even though
the processor supports 64-bit usage. 64-bit usage didn't build when tried and
the Raspberry Pi Foundation promotes 32-bit usage so that's what's used here.

* Primary constituent project versions
  * Erlang 22.0.7
  * [nerves_system_br v1.8.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.8.4)
  * [nerves_toolchain_arm_unknown_linux_gnueabihf v1.2.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
